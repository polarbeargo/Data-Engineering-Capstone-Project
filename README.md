### Instructions

Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data  
Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data  
Step 3: Define the Data Model  
Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data  
Step 5: Complete Project Write Up  

### Scenarios:  
  - If the data was increased by 100x. 
   Let us imagine we are deploying a AWS EMR Start Cluster instance .xlarge with its linearly scalable, we may simply add the number of clusters to increase the performance thus we will be able to adjust the size and number of clusters as we see fit. if the data increased by 100x, we can save data to S3 and switch from a .xlarg to .10xlarge. This one has 640 GiB should be be able to handle it. Another way is to split the data into smaller chunks that can run in parallel thus make the process faster and more efficient.

  - If the pipelines were run on a daily basis by 7am.  
    - The Airflow helps us monitored and scheduler the runtime to avoid running past the 7am. The output data must be stored in an accessible database or accessible in S3 allow the data to search every day if there is new data coming. Assume the pipeline takes approximate 1h to run. Then a schedule should be set for running the pipeline every night at 5am leave a buffer of 1h or combination of Airflow + Spark + Apache Livy in EMR cluster so that Spark commands can be passed through an API interface.     
  - If the database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.  
    - Amazon Redshift Clusters are scaleable with elastic resize such that when ever the database or data warehouse runs the risk of not response the requests anymore, its performance could be increased to handle requests of the authorized 100+ people. Another way is with Amazon RDS, we can deploy scalable PostgreSQL DBs. Through AWS IAM features we can manage user access to our clusters. We could even use something like Amazon Cognito to manage user accounts. It allows us to create a custom sign-up + login page as well as a user management system.
